# Sketch Pad
When I take a break from debugging I unwind by drawing. I thought how wonderful it would be to sketch online. For this project I created a sketch pad, inspired by Etch-a-Sketch in which the artist creates drawings in one stroke of a mouse.

<ul>
<li>Control of grid resolution from smallest (1 x 1) to large (60 x 60)</li>
<li>Coloring tools include black, red, white, and rainbow</li>
</ul>
The artist can control the grid resolution and select different coloring tools to create instant art.
